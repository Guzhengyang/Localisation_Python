# Directory Tree

* **check_package.py**: check a list of Python packages which are needed for the environment
* **utils.py**: basic utility functions which are used by other scripts
* **train.py**: compare different machine learning algorithms(Logistic, LDA, QDA, KNN, SVM, RF, GBM, MLP)
* **deployment.py**: generate Java models using h2o package
* **kalman_sim.py**: illustrate the increased performance for object tracking using Kalman filters(CA or CV model)
* **imu.py**: attempt to use IMU values of smartphone to improve the localization performance(Smartphone and PC need 
  to be in the same network in order to receive the transmitted data by the smartphone)
* **plot_figures.py**: plot analytical figures which are also used by the following report
* **ble-based-smartphone-localization.pdf**: localization report which includes challenge issues and the detailed algorithm
* **log**: RSSI log files for different purposes(training or analysis)
* **model**: generated Java model files which are then used by Android
* **figures**: generated analytical figures which are then used by the localization report
* **data**: intermediate data files generated by the execution of script
* **aoa**
  * **aoa.py**: connect to NXP board and show real time AOA analysis(Argument of each antenna, 
  Argument difference between two successive antenna, spectrum...)
  * **aoa_sim.py**: simulate the AOA results using different antenna arrays(linear, square, circular)
