# Measurement suggestion

## 1. Zone prediction
* walk slowly in each zone with the smartphone in the hand and in the face of the vehicle for 3-4 minutes to obtain a log file
* a number of log files for each zone are needed(>=4 is preferred), this can be done either by demanding different persons  
  or taking the measurements at different time by the same person
* It's better to have different walking paths when constructing data sets for the same zone
* internal measurements can be done by putting the smartphone in some position for a certain time(~5s) and then moving to another
  position 
      
## 2. Coordinate prediction
* the distance between each point is 0.5m, the total measurement size is 11*10m 
* an equipment is preferred in order to stabilize the smartphone when taking the measurement 
* put the smartphone in the equipment and measure for a certain time(10-15s), and then move to another point
* there is a tool in the smartphone IHM in order to memorize the number of the different point
